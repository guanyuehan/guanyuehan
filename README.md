# hi stranger 🙋‍♂️

## About me: 
I am a 17 year old student (M). I am interested in technology and the continuous side of math. I like solving (questionably) hard integrals. Also knows python, html, css, javascript and have successfully forgetten how to code in rust and c++. I'm a fast learner (allegedly). Lately i'v been dabbling in cybersecurity and I'll update my README when I win something good.
